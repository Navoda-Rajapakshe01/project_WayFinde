          Sri Lanka has almost thirteen hundred kilometers of picture postcard
          style wide sandy beaches – where in one place the beach forms sheltered
          little cove, a sandy beach headland or a little bay, of all shapes sizes
          and colours. The more popular beaches are in the southwest of Sri Lanka,
          though little crowded, boast of two of the best snorkeling beaches,
          while other beaches in the deep South and east are waiting for you to
          revel in their remoteness, serenity and unspoilt beauty, and are ideal
          for a refreshing day in the sun. In Sri Lanka beaches are ideal places
          for families and friends to meet and usually head to the beach on
          holidays, weekends, if only to gaze out at the sea. The natural noise of
          crashing waves, where you can walk leisurely along the beach at sunset,
          enjoy a game of cricket on the beach, laze in the sun or cast a rod and
          fish for night’s dinner. Whether it’s a lazy snorkel in crystal clear
          water or dive on a nearby reef, watch blue whales or dive onto a coral
          reef teaming with tropical fish marvelling at the explosion of colours
          hidden beneath the sea, or enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime experience with
          gentle but massive blue whale off the coast of Mirissa or cavort with
          friendly dolphins off Dondra head, Sri Lanka has it all. Fishing is the
          widespread occupation of most folk living along the coastal belt of Sri
          Lanka thus many fishing villages are abound, also the use many different
          ways to catch fish. Most note worthy of mentioning is “stilt fishing”
          technique found in the southern coastal areas. The deep south and
          eastern coastal areas are still under developed as far as tourism is
          concerned, but has the best sceneries’ and also the best places to enjoy
          an authentic village lifestyle, in Sri Lanka. Once the sun dips over the
          horizon a whole new nocturnal world opens up for the visitor with the
          rhythmic moan of the Loris, the long continuous note of the cicada
          bringing a primeval ambience to life. Ideal time to walk along the beach
          to watch fisherman either returning with the days catch, or leaving on
          their daily work, or watch turtles beaching to lay eggs, four types of
          turtles frequent Sri Lankan waters, the turtles are protected by law in
          Sri Lanka and possessing items made from turtle carapace carries
          penalties, but you could support various turtle conservation projects or
          simply watch turtle in their natural habitat, or even get involved in
          releasing young ones to see and watch their mad scramble towards the
          breaking waves.
